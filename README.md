> [!WARNING]
> This pathfinder is still in **HEAVY** development. It is not meant to be used in production. However, you can use the code in `examples` to understand how the pathfinder works.

<h3 align="center">Why use this pathfinder?</h3>

-----

Presently, its execution is better than both Baritone's and mineflayer-pathfinder's. It also follows an entirely different paradigm - each move's execution is split into individual parts, which combined with a modular movement provider/executor/optimizer system, it makes this pathfinder ***extremely*** customizable. So as long as a single movement's execution handles all entry cases (which is possible), it can be immediately integrated into this bot.

Examples will be added as the project undergoes more development.

<h3 align="center">What is left to be done?</h3>

-----

**Many** things.

- [X] Proper breaking of blocks (Cost + Execution)
- [X] Water movement
- [X] Parkour
- [X] Proper jump sprinting
- [ ] Offloading the world thread
